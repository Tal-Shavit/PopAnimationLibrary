# Pop Animation Library
The Pop Animation Library is an Android Studio library that allows developers to easily add dynamic pop-up animations to their applications. With this library, images can either fall from the top of the screen or pop up from the bottom, adding an engaging visual element to your app.

- **Image Count:** Set the number of images to appear in the animation.
- **Animation Type:** Decide whether the images will have a rotation animation (ROTATE) or appear without rotation.
